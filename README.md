## Sex Differences in Cognitive Decline Associated with Tau Pathology
This study examines how tau pathology relates to cognitive decline differently in women and men, using longitudinal data and meta-analytic methods.

## Abstract
In Alzheimer’s disease, in vivo and post-mortem studies show higher levels of AD pathology in women relative to men, yet the implications for cognitive decline remain unclear. Determining the extent to which tau burden differentially accelerates cognitive decline in men and women will provide critical insights into sex-specific pathways of disease progression and may inform tailored prevention and intervention strategies. We leveraged tau-PET, β-amyloid (Aβ)-PET, APOEε4 genotyping, and longitudinal cognitive data over approximately 8.6 [SD=3.8] years from 1,007 cognitively unimpaired adults across three cohorts. We show that higher tau burden in medial and lateral temporal regions is associated with steeper cognitive decline in women compared with men. These results highlight that tau burden carries a disproportionately greater cognitive cost for women, underscoring the need for sex-specific approaches to early detection and therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer’s disease.
